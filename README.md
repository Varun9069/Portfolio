## Current Project
### Did Expectations of Upward Social Mobility Post-COVID Predict Higher Life Satisfaction?

- In times of socio-economic and healtlh system stability, expectations of climbing the social ladder have been linked to greater life satisfaction.
- However, it is unclear whether this relationship is maintained after a significant global crises that creates system instability. 
- Using data collected immediately after COVID-19, I investigated the relationship between social mobility expectations and life satisfaction while taking resilience into account by using multiple regression. Sex differences were also considered.     

### Approach

- I used data from ICPSR's 2022 U.S. National Well-Being Survey, which was collected via telephone between May 10, 2022 and September 5, 2022. 
- Analysis was based on responses from 5,666 adults aged 18-64.  
- To investigate the relationship, mobility expectations, resilience and life satisfaction were used in the multiple regression model. Sex differences were separately considered for mobility expectations and resilience. 


### Results

- We examined how Asian Americans feel after experiencing ingroup prejudice (i.e., prejudice that comes from ingroup members)
- Results showed that Asian Americans who were rejected by Asian peers felt less positive towards Asians compared to their baseline attitudes, whereas experiencing prejudice from White peers did not change participantsâ€™ attitudes towards Whites
- Expectation and prejudice attribution are not related to this difference

### Do People Hold More Prejudice Towards Bisexual Singles?

- We asked people to rate single people with different sexual orientation backgrounds and found that people's assumptions about bisexual single people are more negative than gay/lesbian single people 
- This prejudice primarily comes from non-single people 
- The belief that bisexual people have more choices of potential dating partners partially explains the rating
