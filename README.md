## Current Project
### Do Expectations of Upward Social Mobility Post-COVID Predict Higher Life Satisfaction?

- In times of socio-economic and healtlh system stability, expectations of climbing the social ladder have been linked to greater life satisfaction.
- However, it is unclear whether this relationship is maintained after a significant global crises that creates system instability. 
- Using data collected immediately after COVID-19, I investigated the relationship between social mobility expectations and life satisfaction while taking resilience into account by using multiple regression. Sex differences were also considered.     

### Approach

- Open source data from ICPSR's 2022 U.S. National Well-Being Survey. 
- Analysis based on responses collected via telephone between May 10 - September 5, 2022, from 5,666 adults (ages 18-64).   
- To investigate the relationship, *mobility expectations*, *resilience* and *life satisfaction* were used in the multiple regression model. Sex differences were separately considered for mobility expectations and resilience. 


### Results

- Mobility expectations and resilience both predicted life satisfaction. When resilience was accounted for, mobility expectations were still predictive of life satisfaction
- Immediately after COVID-19, higher mobility expectations predicted lower life satisfaction.

### Do People Hold More Prejudice Towards Bisexual Singles?

- We asked people to rate single people with different sexual orientation backgrounds and found that people's assumptions about bisexual single people are more negative than gay/lesbian single people 
- This prejudice primarily comes from non-single people 
- The belief that bisexual people have more choices of potential dating partners partially explains the rating
